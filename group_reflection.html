    <h2>Working as a team</h2>
    <p>The thing that went best for the team this time around was the overall flow of the team meetings. While there were – of necessity – a couple of longer ones, most were condensed, and predominantly status updates and a chance to share thoughts. What could have been improved was selecting a team leader from the start, as it may have assisted the team to avoid losing as much time early in the project. The team could have also made more of an effort to define tasks earlier in the project. This was the same failing that we had in the second project, and it is clear we did not learn our lesson here. To be fair to the team though, we had a lot of stuff going on that affected us externally, and we were also a week behind due to needing an extension for the previous project. However, we should also have made the effort much sooner to be better organised. With that said, as a team we have pulled together in the end and worked hard to complete the project as best we could in the time remaining. We have created some excellent project artifacts, but even more impressive is how diligently the team has worked to finish the project together.
    </p>
    <p>We have learned that working as a group is hard, especially for a team full of introverts. We feel more comfortable in our own space, doing our own thing. Yet, we have also learned that as individuals we can overcome our inclinations to introversion to work together effectively when we have the motivation to do so. After spending the past 10 weeks working together, there was little that surprised us about each other in terms of our commitment to seeing the project through as a team. Perhaps the biggest surprise for us will be whether we have managed to pull together strongly enough to do better than merely achieve a passing grade. It is also surprising how resilient we have all been. Between team dramas, pandemics, and other crazy life issues, we haven’t given up, and we still work hard together to achieve a reasonable outcome. This is something that perhaps each team member can and should take an element of personal pride in.

      <br>As a group we functioned well, organising ourselves to meet at a regular time and update each other on our progress. Of a positive note was the turnaround rate for feedback that the team has maintained, allowing us to work more effectively as a group rather than individuals cherry-picking written tasks, the group work represents us as a group. We did, however, find ourselves lacking in momentum as we entered this assignment period. This was primarily related to a delayed finish of A2 and losing a team member at a critical time. With these impacts, and Sean’s stepping up to the role of group leader, I have learnt first-hand the importance a leading figure can have in the group to keep momentum when the going gets tough. Overall, this study period has provided a good experience working as a group, and I look forward to maintaining contact with my group members as we each complete our degrees.

      <br>The team's effort in completing Assignment 2 resulted in general team fatigue which caused a prolonged start to Assignment 3. Fortunately, we recognised the need to rework the team's structure, with one team member taking the responsibility of breaking up the work and allocating the different sections so we could progress. Sean, with his experience, was objectively the most skilled to lead this project to completion. While more contributions could have been made in the first weeks of Assignment 3, the lack of clarity on how to handle these large tasks made the assignment quite daunting. It would have been helpful to digest the requirements of each section further as a team to ensure we all had a granular level of understanding of the tasks to be fulfilled; however, with time constraints, this was challenging to accomplish. It was surprising that all team members were conscientiously contributing to the assignment though the course's final weeks meant significant external responsibilities for a few team members, such as final assignments for other subjects. The key takeaway from this group experience was the constant communication stream which was the primary motivator. It led to enforcing the feeling that we were all working with the same goal and had each other's help when needed.

      <br>As a team, when we are working together, we work very well. We communicate frankly and openly, and we each demonstrate a willingness to be inclusive, and to improve the quality of our own work by inviting and accepting the comments of our teammates. Our only real set back as a team was how we kind of imploded at the start of this project. Losing a team member was not easy, and I do not believe that anyone really wanted to see someone leave. For me I took that as a personal failure because I had hoped that there might be a way to reason with the individual and resolve the problems that led to that team member leaving. I later realised that it ended up to the team’s benefit, and perhaps I was too hard on myself, because with the friction gone the team could be more open, and that openness has ensured that we could capture the best of the team’s thoughts and ideas to feed into the project. For me, I will remember this group fondly, and look forward to opportunities to work with each team member again in the future.

      <br>After a shaky start with our A3 due to the loss of a team member and the delayed completion of our A2, which prompted a pause in work allocation and decision making, I believe we settled into a routine. We were able to bring our team together after learning from our previous missteps, with Sean and Marius taking the lead in bringing our A3 and A5 together. Our meeting agendas were adhered to, and the length of the meetings was limited to the allotted time. We were able to complete our jobs because we communicated effectively. Despite our members' busy lives at home, at work, and with their families, as well as the uncertainty and setbacks caused by Covid19's lockdowns, we were all eager to volunteer to help with the tasks at hand and contribute to the content for both assignments.  I found that being a part of Simply Code helped me stay focused and driven to finish my course amid the Covid Pandemic lockdowns. In some ways, I consider myself quite fortunate to have been assigned to a group of intelligent and understanding individuals who have assisted me in completing my first online university course.
