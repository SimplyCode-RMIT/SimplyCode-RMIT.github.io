  <h2> The Team</h2>
      <p><b><a class="work-link" href="https://slrau.github.io/SR-COSC2196A1/">Sean Robins<br>Student ID s3913291</b></a>
      <br>
      Sean is from Melbourne, Australia, and feels honoured to be a member of the student project team
      named ‘Simply Code’ at RMIT University. As the industry veteran of the group, Sean has approximately
      20 years of IT experience, including technical support, network infrastructure and management, as well
      as 13 years as a software developer. Software development experience includes telecommunications,
      hearing, defence, publishing, education, utilities, and construction industries; where Sean has
      specialised primarily in API design, software architecture, and introducing development teams to Agile
      at a time when Agile was considered risky and unproven. Sean’s professional interests lean heavily
      towards Agile software development methodologies such as TDD, BDD, & FDD. He is also keenly
      interested in the many technologies which drive the modern Cloud, in better understanding the
      psychology applicable to great software design, and in teaching others the ‘Zen and Art’ of software
      development. During his personal time, Sean’s interests include coding for fun, 3D printing,
      microcontrollers & IoT, SCUBA diving, kayaking, and crafting an occasional home brewed beer and
      mead.

      <p><b><a class="work-link" href="https://mariusgontran.github.io/my_profile/">Marius Gontran<br>Student ID s3916522</b></a>
      <br>Marius has lived in Melbourne for the past ten years after migrating from Mauritius. His experience in the
      supply chain team for a large national retailer has provided him with a strong knowledge of the transport
      industry. In addition, Marius enjoys keeping up to date with technology news, playing console games, and
      riding his motorcycle in his spare time. While he has been around computers since a very young age, his
      main interest in IT is to enhance his problem-solving ability with new technologies and technical skills.
      Marius is currently acquiring the fundamental concepts of programming through his "Introduction to
      Programming" class and will be experiencing the various essential skills required by an IT professional
      during his Bachelor of Information Technology. One of the first skills which Marius is refining is working in
      a team towards the completion of an IT project as part of Simply Code.</p>
    <p><b><a class="work-link" href="https://kiokizz.github.io/COSC2196-Assignment1-MyProfile/">Kiran Walker<br>
      Student ID s3833410</b></a><br>
      Kiran is a team member of Simply Code. An avid reader, he grew up wanting to be an author. A growing
      sense of wanting to create things was brought to life through watching his dad’s work as a carpenter,
      seeing various projects go from start to finish. This was supported through the IT work of his brother and
      cousin, seeing various projects which he did not understand, brought to life with lines of ‘code’. This
      creative spark led to an entrepreneurial focus during college and university, where Kiran studied business
      and majored in accounting. While studying, Kiran discovered a passion for programming and blockchain
      technology, creating several tools using JavaScript and NodeJS for the blockchain game Splinterlands;
      tools with a focus on providing useful information to the community. This passion led to completing a
      Certificate IV in Programming, followed by the commencement of a Bachelor in IT. In his spare time Kiran
      enjoys photographing nature and reading LitRPG stories online.</p>
    <p><b><a class="work-link" href="https://tiarna-jones.github.io/myprofile-assignment1/">Tiarna Jones<br>
      Student ID s3917038</b></a><br>
      Born and raised in Gold Coast Australia, this 31-year-old mum of 2 is the youngest of 3 sisters. Tiarna
      played basketball throughout her childhood, and unfortunately had to retire recently due to a leg injury.
      Some of Tiarna’s hobbies include reading, watching movies, watching tv shows, having family days,
      barbecues, arts & crafts, playing bingo, and solving escape rooms. At a young age Tiarna enjoyed playing
      games on her computer and her passion for IT grew as she got older. Tiarna and her husband own a real
      estate marketing company, which involves a lot of computer work, mainly using Adobe Photoshop,
      Bridge, Illustrator, and various websites to complete their workload. Tiarna decided to study the course
      “Introduction to Information and Technology” at RMIT to extend her knowledge of computer systems
      and troubleshooting, so she can enhance and grow her business. Areas of interest for study are systems
      diagnosis and recovery, naval communications technologies, and naval signalling and communications.
      These interests are in keeping with Tiarna’s desire to pursue a career in the Royal Australian Navy as a
      Communication and Information Systems Operator. Tiarna is studying to earn a degree in Information
      and Technology and has formed a team known as Simply Code with 5 of her fellow classmates to
      complete group assignments.</p>
    <p><b><a class="work-link" href="https://c-fenby.github.io/Assignment-1/">Charles Fenby<br>
      Student ID s3918359</b></a><br>
      Charles was born and raised in a small town in East Gippsland and is the youngest but the tallest of his 3
      brothers measuring in at 2 meters. After the completion of year 11 Charles decided to pursue a career in
      plumbing – builder and electrician had already been claimed by his brothers, completing his
      apprenticeship early and proceeding to become a talented appliance technician. After the birth of his
      son, Charles has been spending less time on his hobbies of playing video games – which his wife would
      call “making a mess in the shed”, because spending time with his son is now his favorite hobby. Charles
      has always been fascinated by technology, from pulling apart VCRs as a kid to pulling apart appliances
      for work, and now has a thirst for a deeper understanding on a technical level. After attending PAX
      Australia and rubbing shoulders with developers, Charles would often wonder if he could do that. Two
      years later, Charles courageously enrolled to the course: Introduction to Information Technology. This
      has given him the chance to collaborate and learn alongside 5 amazing people in their team named
      ‘Simply Code’.

    <p><b><a class="work-link" href="https://wolf64818.github.io/CPT110Assessment1/">Trillion White<br>
      Student ID s3910969</b></a><br>
      Trill is a part of the team Simply Code and enjoys spending any free time reading, writing, coding, and
      working on IT projects at home. A lot of the enthusiasm for IT and Computers began at a young age,
      when first learning alongside and encouraged by a father who loved to code and learn himself. First
      projects included tinkering with Raspberry Pi, learning many coding languages and finally grew into a
      fervent fascination with anything that had a hard drive. Having completed Year 12, gained excellent
      STAT scores and further tertiary education, Trill's next move is probably chasing down a degree that
      offers to solve truly interesting and challenging problems - whether that be in cyber security, software
      development or general IT.</p>

  <h2> Personalities</h2>
    <p>Simply Code as a team appears on the surface to have a predominantly homogenous personality as a
      group. Since this report is prepared at the start of the project, the team’s thoughts are somewhat
      speculative, and based less on observation, and more on the results of the personality tests that each
      team member took prior to the formation of the team. Each team member took both the 16
      Personalities test, and a comparable Learning Styles test, from which a potential baseline for the group
      might be surmised.
      </p>
    <p>Sean and Kiran were identified as predominantly tactile learners, who would be likely to learn more
      effectively through doing rather than observing. Marius, Tiarna, and Trill are the team’s predominantly
      visual learners, who are more likely to learn effectively through reading and observation. Charles on the
      other is likely to be able to learn effectively first through observation and then applying what he has
      learned, as he is identified as being equally a visual and tactile learner. It is difficult to connect these
      learning styles to the dynamic of the team in terms of its effectiveness while working on this
      assignment. However, the information does perhaps suggest that the visual learners will take more time
      upfront to research and plan their contributions, while the more tactile learners may be keener to make
      a quick start creating their content and perform their research as they go.</p>
    <p>The NERIS Analytics (n.d.) 16 Personalities test applies the NERIS model, which is a blend of the concepts
      introduced in the MyersBriggs and Big-Five (aka OCEAN) personality tests. It is a trait-focused
      personality model without the Jungian concepts on which the other tests were based (Neris Analytics
      n.d.). For this report, team members each contributed their observations regarding the NERIS test
      results for the group. The following radar chart plots the 5 personality scales for each team member:
      </p>
    <img src="neris_radar.png" alt="NERIS 16 Personalities Attributes" class="center">

    <p>The common element shared by each team member is that they all lean entirely towards introversion,
      which is an interesting trait to share as it is meant to mean that each team member is likely to prefer to
      work alone (Neris Analytics n.d.). While this may seem a problem for a team activity, the inference that
      each prefers to work alone implies a possibility that team members will be able to focus on completing
      their tasks without requiring repeated approval or feedback from other team members. The other traits
      appear to be a reasonably balanced spread across the entire team, and while some team members lean
      more towards one personality trait over the other, other team members seem to be more of a balance
      of such opposing traits, and perhaps may be able to bridge such divides. Trillion and Charles were both
      identified as being the Architect personalities, and while their scores vary, their data plots are indeed
      the most similar as compared to the others. Tiarna and Kiran were both identified as Adventurers, Sean
      is a Defender, and Marius a Virtuoso. </p>
    <p>While these personality type names are creative, the Neris (n.d.) descriptions of the personalities
      suggest that there may be some potentially opposing traits between the Defender and Virtuoso on the
      one hand, and the Adventurers and Architects on the other. However, there are also many more traits
      described which suggest a level of compatibility as well, and whether such differences may be sources of
      disharmony or accord are difficult to determine at such an early moment in the team’s journey together.
      Initial observations from team members have been positive and show an eagerness to engage with the
      team and the project.
      </p>
  <h2> Ideal jobs </h2>
      <p>The team’s ideal jobs lean heaviest towards software development, with a two thirds majority in 
      favour of roles requiring skills and experience with computer programming technologies. The remaining 
      third of ideal jobs are in Communications & Information Systems, and in Cybersecurity, and what is 
      particularly surprising was that not only do both roles require nearly identical skillsets, but also
       that the division in this team between software development and IS/security is also strictly gender 
       aligned.</p>
      <img src="ideal_jobs.png" alt="Ideal Jobs" class="center">
      <p>In terms of advertising for the roles, the developer jobs each specified a minimum of 10 or more essential
        skill requirements, with a focus on the technologies particularly required by each advertising company. In
        contrast, the security and communications focused roles were less specific in terms of technologies, and
        more generalised sounding on paper. However, the opposite seems to be the reality, with the
        communications and security roles much more highly specialised and people-oriented, and the software
        developer roles requiring a broader knowledge base with less requirement for specialisation, to a certain
        degree.</p>
      <img src="per_person_skills.png" alt="Per Person Counted Required Skills" class="center">
      <p>Addressing the specific skills, all the advertised roles require the teamwork soft skill, however, other skills
        were also in high demand regardless of the role, such as communication and problem solving for example,
        which both rank highly when each of the roles are compared. Unsurprisingly web-oriented skills have also
        appeared more highly in demand and as a common element for this team, which reflect the way that a
        large proportion of services are delivered online, as will be highlighted in the essay about Clouds, Services
        & Servers within this report.</p>
      <img src="top_10_skills.png" alt="Top 10 Skills for Team's Ideal Jobs" class="center">
      <p>Having only 6 advertised jobs is a very small sample size to analyse meaningfully. Even so, the data seems
        to infer that – on the surface – the team has identified individual roles with several common skills and
        tasks that will be required in many of the types of roles that the team members are most interested in.
        While each role is also somewhat different in scope and duty, the skills required appears to be readily
        transferrable should anyone decide that their ideal role might not be the one they initially identified with.</p>
