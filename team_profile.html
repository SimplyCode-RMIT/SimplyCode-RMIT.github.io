  <h2>The Team</h2>
      <p><b><a class="work-link" href="https://slrau.github.io/SR-COSC2196A1/">Sean Robins<br>Student ID s3913291</b></a>
      <br>
      Sean is from Melbourne, Australia, and feels honoured to be a member of the student project team
      named ‘Simply Code’ at RMIT University. As the industry veteran of the group, Sean has approximately
      20 years of IT experience, including technical support, network infrastructure and management, as well
      as 13 years as a software developer. Software development experience includes telecommunications,
      hearing, defence, publishing, education, utilities, and construction industries; where Sean has
      specialised primarily in API design, software architecture, and introducing development teams to Agile
      at a time when Agile was considered risky and unproven. Sean’s professional interests lean heavily
      towards Agile software development methodologies such as TDD, BDD, & FDD. He is also keenly
      interested in the many technologies which drive the modern Cloud, in better understanding the
      psychology applicable to great software design, and in teaching others the ‘Zen and Art’ of software
      development. During his personal time, Sean’s interests include coding for fun, 3D printing,
      microcontrollers & IoT, SCUBA diving, kayaking, and crafting an occasional home brewed beer and
      mead.
      </p>
      <p><b><a class="work-link" href="https://mariusgontran.github.io/my_profile/">Marius Gontran<br>Student ID s3916522</b></a>
      <br>Marius has lived in Melbourne for the past ten years after migrating from Mauritius. His experience in the
      supply chain team for a large national retailer has provided him with a strong knowledge of the transport
      industry. In addition, Marius enjoys keeping up to date with technology news, playing console games, and
      riding his motorcycle in his spare time. While he has been around computers since a very young age, his
      main interest in IT is to enhance his problem-solving ability with new technologies and technical skills.
      Marius is currently acquiring the fundamental concepts of programming through his "Introduction to
      Programming" class and will be experiencing the various essential skills required by an IT professional
      during his Bachelor of Information Technology. One of the first skills which Marius is refining is working in
      a team towards the completion of an IT project as part of Simply Code.</p>
    <p><b><a class="work-link" href="https://kiokizz.github.io/COSC2196-Assignment1-MyProfile/">Kiran Walker<br>
      Student ID s3833410</b></a><br>
      Kiran is a team member of Simply Code. An avid reader, he grew up wanting to be an author. A growing
      sense of wanting to create things was brought to life through watching his dad’s work as a carpenter,
      seeing various projects go from start to finish. This was supported through the IT work of his brother and
      cousin, seeing various projects which he did not understand, brought to life with lines of ‘code’. This
      creative spark led to an entrepreneurial focus during college and university, where Kiran studied business
      and majored in accounting. While studying, Kiran discovered a passion for programming and blockchain
      technology, creating several tools using JavaScript and NodeJS for the blockchain game Splinterlands;
      tools with a focus on providing useful information to the community. This passion led to completing a
      Certificate IV in Programming, followed by the commencement of a Bachelor in IT. In his spare time Kiran
      enjoys photographing nature and reading LitRPG stories online.</p>
    <p><b><a class="work-link" href="https://tiarna-jones.github.io/myprofile-assignment1/">Tiarna Jones<br>
      Student ID s3917038</b></a><br>
      Born and raised in Gold Coast Australia, this 31-year-old mum of 2 is the youngest of 3 sisters. Tiarna
      played basketball throughout her childhood, and unfortunately had to retire recently due to a leg injury.
      Some of Tiarna’s hobbies include reading, watching movies, watching tv shows, having family days,
      barbecues, arts & crafts, playing bingo, and solving escape rooms. At a young age Tiarna enjoyed playing
      games on her computer and her passion for IT grew as she got older. Tiarna and her husband own a real
      estate marketing company, which involves a lot of computer work, mainly using Adobe Photoshop,
      Bridge, Illustrator, and various websites to complete their workload. Tiarna decided to study the course
      “Introduction to Information and Technology” at RMIT to extend her knowledge of computer systems
      and troubleshooting, so she can enhance and grow her business. Areas of interest for study are systems
      diagnosis and recovery, naval communications technologies, and naval signalling and communications.
      These interests are in keeping with Tiarna’s desire to pursue a career in the Royal Australian Navy as a
      Communication and Information Systems Operator. Tiarna is studying to earn a degree in Information
      and Technology and has formed a team known as Simply Code with 5 of her fellow classmates to
      complete group assignments.</p>
    <p><b><a class="work-link" href="https://c-fenby.github.io/Assignment-1/">Charles Fenby<br>
      Student ID s3918359</b></a><br>
      Charles was born and raised in a small town in East Gippsland and is the youngest but the tallest of his 3
      brothers measuring in at 2 meters. After the completion of year 11 Charles decided to pursue a career in
      plumbing – builder and electrician had already been claimed by his brothers, completing his
      apprenticeship early and proceeding to become a talented appliance technician. After the birth of his
      son, Charles has been spending less time on his hobbies of playing video games – which his wife would
      call “making a mess in the shed”, because spending time with his son is now his favorite hobby. Charles
      has always been fascinated by technology, from pulling apart VCRs as a kid to pulling apart appliances
      for work, and now has a thirst for a deeper understanding on a technical level. After attending PAX
      Australia and rubbing shoulders with developers, Charles would often wonder if he could do that. Two
      years later, Charles courageously enrolled to the course: Introduction to Information Technology. This
      has given him the chance to collaborate and learn alongside 5 amazing people in their team named
      ‘Simply Code’.

  <h2>Group Processes</h2>
    <p>While there were certain drawbacks to working in a group, there were also numerous advantages. The group attended its first online team video meeting, and after introductions decided to work as a team rather than elect a team leader. The way work was split up and allocated to each member was quite effective, and the larger tasks commenced early on. A wiki was implemented in Microsoft Teams to create polls ensuring that everyone's input was heard. Furthermore, the review process worked very well in ensuring that the sections completed by different team members were cohesive and read as a document with a single team voice. Even though there were a few minor hitches along the way, the group’s overall performance and effort resulted in high marks on assignment 2.  
    </p>
    <p>The process modifications made in Assignment 3 were that two of the Simply Code team members – Sean and Marius – have stepped forward to guide team efforts. The team chose to use Marius’ Assignment 1 Project idea, which means he has more knowledge about the basics and has a better idea of how the finished product might look. Sean has a broad understanding of computer systems and applications that the team can draw from when performing the duties allocated to team members. The remaining Simply Code members, Charles, Tiarna, and Kiran have taken on generalised duties, assuming responsibility for some of the content and research for our Assignment 3 and 5 final products.  
    </p>
    
  <h2>Career Plans</h2>
    <p>Most of the ideal jobs for each of the Simply Code team members are software developer jobs. Sean and Marius have a preference to work in the software development industry, Charles wishes to work in backend development, and Kiran wants to work in blockchain development. Tiarna's ideal job is a Communication and Information Systems Operator in the Navy, which is considerably different from the others.
    </p>
    <p>While Sean, Marius, Charles, and Kiran’s chosen ideal jobs are similar in terms of writing code and creating software to solve problems, there are also several between them. Sean and Marius’ ideal job of a software developer, examine a system's capacity and requirements, and the collection, storage, and manipulation of data. They will oversee the design and upkeep of software systems and may also supervise the work of computer technologists, programmers, and technicians. Charles’ preference as a backend developer will focus on the server-side of online applications, including their design, development, and maintenance. The major task of a backend developer is to create the framework of a software program and lay the groundwork for a software team to accomplish its major objectives. Kiran’s career choice of a blockchain developer involves creating systems that collect and preserve blockchain data in a way that prevents fraud and theft, while also providing a ledger of secure digital transactions. Blockchain developers construct application features and interfaces, as well as client and server-side apps, and design secure blockchain technology.
    </p>
    <p>Tiarna's ideal work is in a significantly different profession, involving the Australian Defence Force and not solely IT. While the rest of the team requires a university degree, Tiarna will instead complete 11 weeks of basic military training on-site in Victoria after passing the Navy's fitness, physical, and psychological tests. On completion of basic training, Tiarna will complete a 40-week specialty course aimed at preparing her for a career as a Communication and Information Systems Operator, during which she'll learn how to operate complex telecommunication technology systems, visual communication systems, information technology systems, diagnose and recover systems, defend computer networks, manage information, provide tactical advice to Command on signalling and ship movement, communicate via a variety of systems such as teletype, satellite, and morse code, and other specialties. On successful completion of this specialty course, Tiarna will have graduated as a full member of the Royal Australian Defence force as a Communication and Information Systems Operator in the Navy where she will extend all she has learned through applied experience.
