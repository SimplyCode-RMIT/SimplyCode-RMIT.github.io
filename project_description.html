        <p>It is recommended to spend 15-20 minutes outside per day for an adult, 1.5-2 hours for preschool aged children, and a minimum of 3 hours for school aged children (Kim, 2019) to achieve the benefits that being outdoors can bring, such as Vitamin D synthesis for bone health, and enhancing creativity and emotional stability. The average person spends approximately 87% of their time indoors, and children average only 4-7 minutes outdoors (Kim, 2019), which suggests an opportunity for a service that can encourage people to spend more time outdoors in their local parks and other activity locations. Simply Code has conceived project named ‘Strolly Poly’, which intended to offer such a service, filling the gaps between the search apps and services currently available.  Strolly Poly will provide targeted and relevant information to users, and a system to keep users engaged while encouraging them to contribute to the creation and maintenance of information in the system, all with minimal administrative oversight.  
        </p>
        <p>Since the start of the COVID 19 pandemic the number of calls to counselling services such as Lifeline (n.d) has increased, identifying the emergence of a need to improve people’s physical and mental wellbeing. However, time outdoors maybe difficult to achieve due to exposure sites and restrictions reducing time available for people to spend on outdoor activities. Strolly Poly is intended to make the search for parks and outdoor areas easier and safer, allowing relevant information to be digested quickly to spend less time looking for places to visit, and more time at a location participating in activities that people enjoy outdoors. 
        </p>
        <p>The motivation for this application has been drawn from several areas, such as finding places to visit with family and pets, seeking alternative locations away from COVID hot spots, to wanting to have time away from everything and focus on personal and physical wellbeing. of the introduction of an application such as Strolly Poly is intended to make the search for parks and outdoor areas easier and more rewarding, encouraging people to spend more time outdoors, and discover new places to visit that might have been previously unnoticed. To further encourage user participation, Strolly Poly is designed to be community driven, rewarding users for their participation with in-app achievements that contribute to unlocking app features. This is a system of engagement that follows the trend of Pokémon Go, Witcher Monster Slayer and Fit Bit to define new and interesting ways to encourage people to go outside, be more active, and improve their wellbeing, while remining COVID safe. In addition, the project offers team members an opportunity to be involved in a project that requires a diverse skillset, which may subsequently result in future employment and business opportunities. 
        </p>
        <p>When reflecting on the app's purpose, the team considered whether an existing platform such as Google's "Local guides" feature already fulfils the user's requirements and whether the app would be more beneficial to the users than the world's most used search engine (GlobalStats 2021). The team decided that existing services are not purpose built and capture only a fraction of the information that is relevant to the purpose. Google Guides can quickly bring up a list of the nearest parks, however, the details returned do not provide the key information that users are likely to be looking for. Users might use Facebook groups to provide such information, yet the posts can quickly be lost in the general noise of the group.  Further, the information is rarely peer validated and these platforms offer no protection against false or misleading information.  The proposed initial feature set for Strolly Polly provides a consistent level of information across all locations reviewed to make it easier to search for places best suited to users' activities or needs. For example, it should be effortless for a young family to find a park nearby with adequate play equipment for their children while also offering a working barbecue station and sufficient car parking. Current products and services are unable to satisfy such specific search requests.
